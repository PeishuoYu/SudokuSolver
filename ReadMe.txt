In this folder there are:
	testcase/1...125	125 testcases downloaded from http://cn.sudokupuzzle.org
	Sudoku.py		a Sudoku Solver that can solve most questions in 5 seconds
	QuestionDownloader.py	a program that will empty the testcase folder and download questions
				from website on demand

Information about http://cn.sudokupuzzle.org:
	This website updates Sudoku questions daily. So given the difficulty lever and a data
	range, my program will be able to acquire many Sudoku testcases.

Why I developed this program:
	My friend took a online test from deloitte, and there were Sudoku questions in it.
	After hearing this, I wanted to challenge myself to see whether I could develop an 
	efficient algorithm that can solve Sudoku questions. And finally I did it.
